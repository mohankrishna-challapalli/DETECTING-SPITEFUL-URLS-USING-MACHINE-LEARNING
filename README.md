# Spam-URL-Detecction
URLs are the main culprit for any web attacks such that any malicious intention
user can hack the identity of the legal person by sending the malicious URL.
Malicious URLs are a cornerstone of Internet criminal activities. The dangers of
these sites have created a demand for safeguards that protect end-users from
visiting them.

We are proposing a learning based approach such as Blacklisting to classify
Web sites into 3 classes: Benign, Spam and Malware and this analyzes the
Uniform Resource Locator (URL) itself without accessing the content of Web
sites and it eliminates the runtime latency and the possibility of exposing users
to the browser based vulnerabilities.

By employing learning algorithms, our scheme achieves better performance on
generality.
